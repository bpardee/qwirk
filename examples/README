You can use the default InMem adapter or modify the qwirk.yml file to setup the proper credentials for your ActiveMQ server.

In general, you can run the examples as follows:

rackup
  or for Inline
QWIRK_ADAPTER=inline rackup (for inline, only send a few messages as these happen synchronously)
  or for ActiveMQ with a separate server
QWIRK_ADAPTER=active_mq_invm rackup
  or for ActiveMQ invm
QWIRK_ADAPTER=active_mq_invm rackup
